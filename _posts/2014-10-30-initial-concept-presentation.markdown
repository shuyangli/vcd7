As promised, I just uploaded my initial concept presentation board, with problem statement, design features, and a task flow. You can [view the board here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20141030-concept-presentation-board.pdf).

Bonus: here's the [initial design wireframe]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20141030-awake-tea-latte-wireframe.pdf) for the same interface, for the task of "checking out an Awake Tea Latte with soy milk and extra syrup". Such a big change!

A semi-functional prototype could be found [on my website]({{ site.url }}/project/vcd7-starbucks/) as well.
