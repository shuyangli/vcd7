summary:    I'm making a light that responds to sound for the interactive widget project.

After thinking about the technical challenges and the possible ways to make the widget, I've settled on the third idea for the interactive widget. However, to make it more interesting, instead of making a really simple light, I would make the light respond to sound/music playing nearby, and make it flash to the beats. You can still turn off the light by turning the entire enclosure upside-down.

It's really fun to think through this entire project, including designing the form factor, writing the code, building the circuit, and assembling the enclosure. Here are some videos I captured during the process!
