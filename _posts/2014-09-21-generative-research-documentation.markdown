My generative research on the Starbucks register is finally done, and it's been a lot of fun watching the novice failing on the tasks.

Here're the four tasks the users are asked to complete:

![Task 1: Awake Tea Latte]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20140922-taskflow-1.png)
<span class="small mid-gray">Task 1: Check out an Awake Tea Latte and pay with Student ID</span>

![Task 2: Coffee and Credit]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20140922-taskflow-2.png)
<span class="small mid-gray">Task 2: Check out a Blonde Roast Coffee and pay with credit card</span>

![Task 3: Starbucks Mint]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20140922-taskflow-3.png)
<span class="small mid-gray">Task 3: Check out a Starbucks After Coffee Mint</span>

![Task 4: Gift Card Reload]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20140922-taskflow-4.png)
<span class="small mid-gray">Task 3: Reload $15 on a Gift Card</span>

Here are some things our users have complained during and in between the tasks:
- The big yellow "manager" button doesn't do anything;
- The "scannable" button does nothing;
- Colors are very unattractive;

I also gathered some feedback from both the expert and the novice after the tasks:

- Expert

> The interface is not easy to use; it was very hard to avoid making mistakes at the beginning, and even after she has worked there for a year, she mess things up occasionally.
> The buttons are disorganized, and there're random TBD buttons in the system.
> Some items are not in the system (Mint, for example), so she has to manually type in the amount.
> The Trenta-sized drinks are in the "brewed coffee" category, which is very counterintuitive.
> Gift card checkout procedure is annoying: if the customer is using the mobile app, she has to manually punch in the card number to the gift card POS.

- Novice

> It's very hard to find where the items are on the register, and checking out any complex item is hard.
> Many buttons don't do anything at some times.
> The flow is very poor, and feedback is confusing. There's no prompt on what to do after you perform an action.

And here's the final video documentation!
