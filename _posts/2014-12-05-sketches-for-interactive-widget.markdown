I'm almost settled down on the idea of building something that involves a light, but the form factor keeps tripping me up. My original idea is a glass-shaped light, but making it might be very hard. Here are some ideas and alternative solutions I've thought of:

![Concept 1: a box]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20141205-skecth-1.png)
<span class="small mid-gray">Concept 1: a box light with orientation sensitivity.</span>

![Concept 2: a tower]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20141205-skecth-2.png)
<span class="small mid-gray">Concept 2: inspired by the Mac Pro.</span>

![Concept 3: an hourglass]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20141205-skecth-3.png)
<span class="small mid-gray">Concept 3: an hourglass that stresses the idea of orientation sensitivity.</span>

![Concept 4: a lantern]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20141205-skecth-4.png)
<span class="small mid-gray">Concept 4: a lantern; this would emphasize the texture, but puts interaction at the second place.</span>
