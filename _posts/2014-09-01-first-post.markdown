I'm super excited to take the [VCD7: Interaction Design](http://www3.nd.edu/~amurniek/2014fa/desn31140-fa14.html) class! Last Wednesday (August 27) was our first class, and we did a quick experiment on how to mirror an iPad to the screens in the computer lab in West Lake Hall.

The mirroring controls are AWFUL!
