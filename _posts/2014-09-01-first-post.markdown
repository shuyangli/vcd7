I'm super excited to take the [VCD7: Interaction Design](http://www3.nd.edu/~amurniek/2014fa/desn31140-fa14.html) class! Last Wednesday (August 27) was our first class, and we did a quick experiment on how to mirror an iPad to the screens in the computer lab in West Lake Hall.

The controls are AWFUL!

Well, they're not the worst I've seen, but in general these projection controls are difficult to work with. There're usually a million buttons all over the place, and no one ever uses all of them.

For this specific box, there are some tricks, as usual:

- You need to know if you're using VGA or HDMI, and I assume not many people even know they are different;
- You have to press "Join Rooms" before choosing the source, or things will break;
- The volume knob is very gentle, and you have to roll it very far to make the volume up.

So for this exercise, we made a quick movie with AfterEffects to show how the process works:

This is such a painful process, but hopefully after this course I can fix it, as well as other bad user interfaces!
