When I was a freshman, I used to like the Starbucks® on campus (I still do, and I pretty much live in Starbucks) and wanted to work there to earn some extra cash. However, I realized that the Baristas® very often press wrong buttons, and when chatting with them, they always complain about the checkout system. So one day I finally decided to walk around the counter, and…

![Starbucks Counter Initial Screen]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20140902-starbucks-initial-screen.jpg)
<span class="small mid-gray">Starbucks Counter Initial Screen</span>

_Ugh._

_Really?_

## Current Issues

- It looks __really messy…__
    - _Welcome to 1995!_
    - Hello, I want a _Scanna-ble!_
    - The buttons on the left look completely randomly thrown together;
    - Why do some buttons have icons, and others don't?
    - People seldom use the number pad, so where is it there?

- The __color__ is all wrong! Do they mean anything, or are the colors randomly jammed together as well?

- The __labeling is very confusing__:
    - Espresso Trad?
    - Espresso?
    - PROMO Espresso?

Let's dig a little deeper, and we can find more issues:

![Starbucks Counter Item Chooser Screen]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20140902-starbucks-item-screen.jpg)
<span class="small mid-gray">Item Chooser Screen</span>

- May I have a __tbd__, please?

- What's the "Starbucks Starbucks bucks Neal" all about?

- Why can't we select the size directly, but have to choose "drink + size"?

And let's see a new Barista® getting confused. See how he hesitate when looking for the right button to press:

## Redesign Opportunities

- Aesthetically it could be way better. _It's the 21th century now!_
    - The buttons look terribly dated;
    - Layout is downright horrible;
    - Coloring don't make sense either.

- The logic behind grouping of products is very weird.

- User interaction logic can be drastically improved/redesigned.

This would be a very interesting project to work on, as it's very applicable to me (hey, I live in Starbucks), and it could be both visually and logically refreshing.
