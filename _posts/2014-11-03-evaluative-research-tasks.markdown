summary:    Here are the questions I'll use to evaluate my redesign.

1. Can you help me check out a Grande Awake Tea Latte, with soy milk and extra syrup, and pay with Student ID?
2. Can you help me check out a Grande Blond Roast Coffee, and check out with credit card?
3. Can you help me check out a Starbucks Mint, and pay with $5 cash? The Mint is not in the system, but it costs $2.25.
4. Can you help me reload $15 onto my Starbucks Card, and pay for that with credit card?

Just a reminder: for any card transactions, when the system prompts you to swipe the card, if you hit the prompt, it will simulate a card swipe for you.

While you're trying to finish these tasks, could you talk out loud about what you're thinking when you do something?
