So you're a Barista working at the Starbucks in LaFun, and I'm a customer in line trying to buy some drinks. Can you do the following:

1. Can you check out a Grande Awake Tea Latte, with soy milk and extra syrup, and take my Student ID?
2. Can you check out a Grande Blond Roast Coffee with credit card?
3. Can you check out a Starbucks Mint, and take my $5 cash? (Hint: The Mint is not in the system, but it costs $2.25.)
4. Can you reload $15 onto my Starbucks Card, and take my credit card?

Just a reminder: for any card transactions, when the system prompts you to swipe the card, if you hit the prompt, it will simulate a card swipe for you.

While you're trying to finish these tasks, could you talk out loud about what you're thinking when you do something?
